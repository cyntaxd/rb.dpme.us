            <p>ROADBLOCK was made by a student who felt that most game sites didn't update their links once they were blocked, and that was an issue. All proxies and game links do not come from other sites. They come from forked repositories of github projects, so you can ensure that what you are using from this site, you can't get from anywhere else. This method also allows the creator to easily duplicate sites and links.</p>
            <p>There are no reliable game sites, with most dying after only a few months of being up. ROADBLOCK is here to defy the odds. While ROADBLOCK isn't the first one walking a road littered with the corpses of other failed game sites, the site developer is hoping that this site, unlike the many unfortunate others, will not be one of the corpses on the road.</p>
            <br>
            <p>This website was completely coded in VSCode Editor, using HTML, CSS, and JS, and published onto W3 Schools' website hosting service.</p>
